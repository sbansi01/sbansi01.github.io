    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C). Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty foil, dull side up, and spray with nonstick cooking spray or brush the pan with oil. Pour 1/2 cup (28 g) of the panko crumbs onto the prepared pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, water, hot sauce, salt, and pepper until smooth. Add the cauliflower florets into the bowl and gently toss to coat thoroughly. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cauliflower onto the panko on the prepared pan. Scatter the remaining panko over the cauliflower and toss to coat, then spread the florets out so there is some space for air to circulate around them in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake the cauliflower for 20 minutes, or until the coating is set and beginning to brown in places.</li>
        <li>Use a thin, flexible spatula to transfer the cauliflower to another mixing bowl, toss with the Garlic Buffalo Wing Sauce, and then spread the florets back out on the pan. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has started to brown in places on the cauliflower.</li>
        <li>If desired, drizzle additional wing sauce over the Buffalo Cauliflower "Wing" Bites and serve garnished with green onions and with blue cheese dressing for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
